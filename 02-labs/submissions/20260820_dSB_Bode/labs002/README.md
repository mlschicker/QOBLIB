| Best Objective Value | 1 |
| Optimality Bound | N/A |

| Modeling Approach | HUBO (degree-4 spin polynomial, native — no quadratization) |
| # Decision Variables | 2 |
| # Binary Variables | 2 |
| # Integer Variables | 0 |
| # Continuous Variables | 0 |
| # Non-Zero Coefficients | 0 |
| Coefficients Type | integer |
| Coefficients Range | N/A |
| ====== |  |
| Workflow | Pre-processing: expand E(s)=Σ_k C_k(s)^2 into a degree-4 spin polynomial and cancel repeated indices via s_i^2=1, giving a native HUBO over N spins (no quadratization, no auxiliary variables, no penalty parameter). Pre-solvers: none. Main algorithm: discrete Simulated Bifurcation (Goto et al.) integrated with symplectic Euler at fixed step, coupling evaluated at sign(x), perfectly-inelastic walls at \|x_i\|=1, pump detuning ramped linearly to zero. Independent random restarts differ only in the initial momenta. Post-processing: none (no local search or polishing applied). |

| Remarks | LABS is unconstrained: every ±1 sequence is feasible, so # Feasible Runs = # Runs. One run = one independent dSB restart from random initial momenta; the reported value is best-of-72448, found in 72448 of them. No post-processing of any kind was applied — no local search, no 1-opt or tabu polish — so this is raw dSB output. N=2 is degenerate: E(s) = (s_1 s_2)^2 = 1 for every sequence, so the spin polynomial has no variable terms and no coefficient range is reported. Run as a depth portfolio: the 420 s budget was split evenly across n_steps ∈ {2500, 20000, 160000}, each arm receiving 140 s. The reported value came from the n_steps = 2500 arm. Total Runtime is measured, not budgeted, and exceeds the nominal budget because an arm's deadline is tested before a batch starts rather than during it. CPU Runtime is wall time x the 128 cores the process ran on; threads and cores are 1:1 throughout, so this is measured machine time rather than an oversubscription artefact. Optimality Bound is N/A: dSB proves nothing. |
