# Contributing to QOBLIB

We welcome contributions to the Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library! This guide outlines how to submit solutions and report benchmarking results.

## Submission Process

To contribute a solution to any problem instance, please submit your results via **Pull Request** to this repository. 

Please follow the guidelines below when preparing your submission.

## Validating Your Submission

Before submitting, validate your submission structure and contents using the automated checker tool provided in [misc/check_submission.py](misc/check_submission.py). 
The checker verifies directory structure, CSV format consistency, and can optionally validate solutions. For detailed usage instructions and options, see [misc/README.md](misc/README.md).

The same checker runs automatically on every pull request and posts its result as a comment; a red run blocks the merge until it is fixed.

### What is required of a solution

The per-problem checkers report a fact about your solution file, and the pipeline
then applies a policy based on **what your CSV declares** (see
[misc/CHECKER_CONTRACT.md](misc/CHECKER_CONTRACT.md) for the full exit-code table):

- **Your solution file must always be valid** — it must parse and match the
  instance's dimensions/format. A malformed file always fails, regardless of what
  you declare.
- **Feasibility is only required if you claim it.** If a run did not produce a
  feasible solution, set **`# Feasible Runs` to `0`** for that instance. The checker
  will then accept the (valid) solution file even though it violates constraints —
  useful for reporting exploratory or withdrawn runs honestly. If `# Feasible Runs`
  is `> 0` (or left blank), at least one submitted solution file must be feasible.
- **Optimality is never required for a submission.** A valid, feasible heuristic
  solution that is not optimal is accepted. Optimality is only cross-checked when you
  **assert a proven optimum** by setting **`Optimality Bound` equal to your
  `Best Objective Value`**; leave `Optimality Bound` as `N/A` for a heuristic run.
  (`# Successful Runs` is measured against your algorithm's own best, not the global
  optimum, so it does not trigger an optimality check.) The curated best-known
  solutions under `NN-problem/solutions/` are governed separately.

### Best-known values are updated automatically

You do **not** need to touch any `solutions/` directory. When your submission is
merged, `.github/workflows/update-bkv.yml` recomputes each problem's best-known
value from the reference solutions plus every feasible submission, and:

- copies your solution file into `NN-problem/solutions/` when it improves the
  best-known value (for problems stored as one solution file per instance), and
- regenerates the best-known table inside `NN-problem/solutions/README.md`, listing each
  instance's best-known value and the **first source** that reached it — a link to the
  crediting submission, or `reference` for a curated/literature solution.

The best-known value is awarded to the *first* source to reach it: reference
solutions are the baseline, so a submission is credited only when it is the earliest
source to strictly improve the previous best. Attribution is computed from your CSV's
`Best Objective Value` and `# Feasible Runs`, so keep those accurate. You can preview
the result locally with `python misc/update_bkv.py --check`.

## Submission Requirements

Each benchmark submission should include:

### Required Information

1. **Problem instance identifier** - Which instance(s) were solved
2. **Submitter details** - Name(s) of the author(s). For multiple authors, provide a comma-separated list wrapped in double quotes (e.g. `"Jane Doe, John Roe"`) so the CSV parses correctly.
3. **Affiliation** - Affiliation of the author(s). For multiple authors, provide a comma-separated list wrapped in double quotes, in the same order as the authors (e.g. `"University A, Company B"`). Repeat an affiliation when several authors share it so that the number of affiliations matches the number of authors.
4. **Submission date**
5. **Best objective value found** (for optimization problems)
6. **Solution file** - In the format specified for the problem class (see solution folders)
7. **Reference** - Link to paper, code repository, or detailed documentation with:
   - Hyperparameters
   - Complete hardware specifications
   - Software versions
   - Additional implementation details

### Model Information

- **Modeling approach** - How the problem instance was formulated
- **Decision variables** - Total count and breakdown by type:
  - Number of binary variables
  - Number of integer variables
  - Number of continuous variables
- **Coefficients**:
  - Number of non-zero coefficients (in objective and constraints)
  - Coefficient types (integer, binary, continuous)
  - Coefficient range (min/max values)

### Algorithm Details

#### Workflow Description
Briefly summarize the complete optimization workflow to facilitate reproducibility:
- **Pre-processing** - Data preparation and problem reformulation
- **Pre-solvers** - Any classical pre-solving techniques applied
- **Main optimization algorithm** - Core method used
- **Post-processing** - Solution refinement and validation

#### Algorithm Characteristics
- **Algorithm type** - Deterministic or stochastic
- **Paradigm** - Either: Classical, Quantum Simulator, Quantum Hardware
- **Optimality bound** (if available) - Lower bound (minimization) or upper bound (maximization)

#### For Stochastic Algorithms
Multiple runs are recommended. Please report:
- **\# Runs** - Total number of independent runs
- **\# Feasible Runs** - Runs that produced feasible solutions
- **\# Successful Runs** - Runs achieving near-optimal solutions within threshold
- **Success Threshold (ε)** - Number of runs that found a feasible solution with objective value $\leq (1 + \epsilon) * f_{min}$ (minimization) or $\geq (1 - \epsilon) * f_{max}$ (maximization), where $f_{min}/f_{max}$ is the best solution found by the algorithm.


### Hardware and Runtime

#### Hardware Specifications
Provide complete specifications for all hardware used in the workflow.

#### Runtime Reporting
Report average runtimes across all repetitions (exclude queuing time for hardware access):
- **Total Runtime** - End-to-end execution time
- **Time to Solution** - Time to find the best solution
- **CPU Runtime** - Classical processing time
- **GPU Runtime** - GPU acceleration time (if applicable)
- **QPU Runtime** - Quantum processing unit time (if applicable)
- **Other Hardware Runtime** - Any additional specialized hardware

> **Note:** For multiple runs, report the average runtime. Distributions of runtimes and correlations with solution quality are encouraged to be described in referenced publications.

## Best Practices

### Solution Files
- Follow the format specified in each problem class directory
- Include validation information when applicable
- Name files according to the instance naming convention

### Documentation
- Be as detailed as possible in your reference material
- Include reproducible instructions
- Document any deviations from standard approaches
- Report negative results (valuable for the community!)

### Stochastic Algorithms
- Run multiple independent trials (recommend 10+ runs, required 5+ runs)
- Report statistical measures (mean, median, std dev) when possible
- Document random seeds for reproducibility

### Runtime Measurements
- Measure wall-clock time for total runtime
- Separate classical and quantum processing times
- Exclude compilation and queue times
- Report hardware specifications completely
