    Warning: this simplification explicitly changes the problem. After
    simplification, the given problem may not even correspond to the same
    class as the orgiginal problem.

    The problem is simplified according to the number of layers of SWAP gates
    that it takes to implement the connectivity required by the QUBO on a
    line of qubits. If an entry `Q[i, j]` requires `k` or more layers then it
    is not implemented and simply set to zero. The intent is to create a continuity
    of problem instances that are harder and harder. This makes it possible to
    benchmark performance on noisy quantum hardware.

    Args:
        file_name: The .qs file to read.
        number_of_layers: The number of swap layers allowed, i.e., `k`. If the QUBO
            is of dimension `n x n`, i.e., `n` binary variables, then `n - 2` layers
            of swap gates are sufficient to implement full connectivity. Therefore,
            this variable should take on values between 0 and `n - 2`.
