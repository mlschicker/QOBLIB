# `misc/` — QOBLIB tooling

Utility scripts, the data-pipeline code, and shared binaries used across all
problem classes. Everything here is organised into a few clearly-scoped
subdirectories and is installable/runnable with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## Layout

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| [`ci/`](ci/) | **Workflow / CI scripts** run by GitHub Actions — the static-site builder, the submission checker, and the best-known-value updater — plus the shared `site_builder` package and the checker contract. Standard-library only. See [`ci/README.md`](ci/README.md). |
| [`tools/`](tools/) | **Standalone maintenance utilities** (format converters, metric extraction, QUBO simplification, figure generation, licensing). Each is independently runnable; the heavy ones declare their own dependencies inline. See [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md). |
| [`bin/`](bin/) | Third-party **binaries** (the ZIMPL modeling-language executable). |
| [`generators/`](generators/) | Notes on the external QUBO-generation toolchains. |
| [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) | One-off Jupyter notebooks (e.g. the historical submission migration). |
| `submission_template.csv` | The canonical 30-column submission template (referenced from `CONTRIBUTING.md`). |
| `pyproject.toml`, `.python-version`, `uv.lock` | Packaging + pinned interpreter for the `uv` environment. |

## Installing / running with uv

The CI tools have **no third-party dependencies**, so the base environment is
tiny. From the repository root:

```bash
# Create the environment (downloads Python 3.12 if needed) and run a tool:
uv run --project misc qoblib-update-bkv --check
uv run --project misc qoblib-build-site --out _site
uv run --project misc qoblib-check-submission <problem>/submissions/<name>

# Or install the console scripts into an isolated tool environment:
uv tool install ./misc            # exposes qoblib-* on your PATH
```

Installed console scripts (defined in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml)):

| Command | Script |
| --- | --- |
| `qoblib-build-site` | [`ci/build_site.py`](ci/build_site.py) |
| `qoblib-update-bkv` | [`ci/update_bkv.py`](ci/update_bkv.py) |
| `qoblib-check-bkv` | [`ci/check_bkv_updates.py`](ci/check_bkv_updates.py) |
| `qoblib-check-submission` | [`ci/check_submission.py`](ci/check_submission.py) |

### Heavy tools (optional extras)

The QUBO / metric utilities pull larger dependencies. They are exposed both as
extras of this project and as self-contained [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/)
scripts, so the simplest invocation needs no install at all:

```bash
# Simplest: the script header (PEP 723) declares its own deps, uv resolves them:
uv run misc/tools/convert_lp2qubo.py <file.lp.xz>
uv run misc/tools/get_metrics.py --help

# Or add the deps to the project environment via an extra (qubo | metrics | tables):
uv sync --project misc --extra qubo
```

All scripts also carry a shebang and are executable, so `./misc/tools/<name>.py`
works directly (the heavy ones via `uv run --script`).
